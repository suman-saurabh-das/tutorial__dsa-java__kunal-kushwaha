/*
	‚Ä¢ Every file with extension .java is itself a class.
	‚Ä¢ class - Named group of properties and functions.
        ‚Ä¢ By convention, class names should start with a capital letter.
        ‚Ä¢ The public class and file name should be exactly same.

	‚Ä¢ public - Access modifier - It means this class can be accessed from anywhere.

	‚Ä¢ To run a java program, write below commands in terminal -
		‚Ä¢ javac filename.java - Creates the .class file from .java file.
		‚Ä¢ java filename - Runs the byte code present in .class file.

	‚Ä¢ methods - group of code which can be run again and again. (functions inside classes are called as methods)

	‚Ä¢ main() method - entry point for the java program, it should be having public access modifier so that it can be accessed from anywhere.

	‚Ä¢ static - static variables and methods, do not depend on the object. (we can access these functions or properties without creating an object of the class)

	‚Ä¢ void - return type of our method.

	‚Ä¢ String[] args - command line arguments (array of strings) whatever arguments we provide in terminal while running the code will be stored in this array.

	‚Ä¢ package - folder where our java file lies. (used to organize the files and add data privacy)

	‚Ä¢ System class - it is inside the java.lang package and is inherited by default. It contains several useful methods. e.g. for output we have print and println.
